This project was used to get familiar with PHP/Silex/Twig/PHPUnit/PHPMyAdmin.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/)

## Installation

## Running / Development

* Open PHPMyAdmin by going to localhost:8080/phpmyadmin in your web browser
* In phpmyadmin choose the Import tab and choose your database file and click Go. It's important to make sure you're not importing to a database that already exists, so make sure that a database with the same name as the one you're importing doesn't already exist.
